*Calculus* is a branch of mathematics that involves the study of rates of change. Before calculus was invented, all **math was static**: It could only help calculate objects that were *perfectly still.*

But **the universe is constantly moving and changing.** *No* objects—from the stars in space to subatomic particles or cells in the body—are *always at rest.* Indeed, just about everything in the universe is constantly moving. Calculus helped to determine how particles, stars, and matter actually move and change in **real time.**


**Limits:**
Consider the function f(x) = x^22. Observe that as x takes values very close to 0,
the value of f(x) also moves towards 0

We say

`lim f(x) = 0 as x---> 0`
