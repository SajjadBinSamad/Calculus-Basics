*Calculus* is a branch of mathematics that involves the study of rates of change. Before calculus was invented, all **math was static**: It could only help calculate objects that were *perfectly still.*

But **the universe is constantly moving and changing.** *No* objects—from the stars in space to subatomic particles or cells in the body—are *always at rest.* Indeed, just about everything in the universe is constantly moving. Calculus helped to determine how particles, stars, and matter actually move and change in **real time.**


**Limits:**

> The mathematical microscope that lets you sort of zoom in on a curve to the sub-, sub-, sub-atomic level, where it becomes straight.

Consider the function f(x) = x^2. Observe that as x takes values very close to 0,
the value of f(x) also moves towards 0

We say

`lim f(x) = 0 as x---> 0`

Limits: The mathematical microscope that lets you sort of zoom in on a curve to the sub-, sub-, sub-atomic level, where it becomes straight.

Consider the function f(x)=3x+1. When we say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches 2 is 7, written as $\lim _{x\to 2\}f\left(x\right)=7$ , we mean that as x gets closer and closer to 2 from the left and the right,  gets closer and closer to a height of 7. By the way, as far as I know, the number 2 in this example doesn’t have a formal name, but we can call it the arrow-number. The arrow-number gives you a horizontal location in the x direction. Don’t confuse it with the answer to the limit problem or simply the limit, both of which refer to a y-value or height of the function.

Formal definition of limit: Let f be a function and let c be a real number.

$\lim _{x\to c}\:f\left(x\right)$ exists if and only if

1.  $\lim _{x\to c-}\:f\left(x\right)$
2.  $\lim _{x\to c-}\:f\left(x\right)$
3.  and $\lim _{x\to c-}\:f\left(x\right)$ = $\lim _{x\to c-}\:f\left(x\right)$


Calculus books always present this as a three-part test for the existence of a limit, but condition 3 is the only one we need to worry about because 1 and 2 are built into 3. We just have to remember that we can’t satisfy condition 3 if the left and right sides of the equation are both undefined or nonexistent; in other words, it is not true that undefined = undefined or that nonexistent = nonexistent. (I think this is why calc texts use the 3-part definition.) As long as you’ve got that straight, condition 3 is all you need to check.

**Differentiating: It’s Just Finding the Slope**

Differentiation is the first of the two major ideas in calculus (the other is integration). Differentiation is the process of finding the derivative of a function like $y=x^2$.The derivative is just a fancy calculus term for a simple idea we know from algebra: slope. Slope, as we know, is the fancy algebra term for steepness. And steepness is the fancy word for … No! Steepness is the ordinary word we’ve known since we were a kid, as in, “Hey, this road sure is steep.” Everything we study in differential calculus all relates back to the simple idea of steepness.

**Integration: Just Fancy Addition**

Integration has an elegant symbol: $\int $. You’ve probably seen it before — maybe in one of those cartoons with some Einstein guy in front of a blackboard filled with indecipherable gobbledygook. Soon, this will be you. That’s right: You’ll be filling up pages in your notebook with equations containing the integration symbol. Onlookers will be amazed and envious.

You can think of the integration symbol as just an elongated S for “sum up.”
